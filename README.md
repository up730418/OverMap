# Custom Map Elements

The current version can be found at: https://up730418.github.io/sprint-3/index.html

The idea of this project is to create an extensible web component that can take two or more maps from different providers and display them over each other. 

This can be used to check the correctness of a map or check for discrepancies between providers.
