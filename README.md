# OverMap

The current version can be found at: https://up730418.github.io/OverMap/index.html

The idea of this project is to create an extensible web component that can take two or more maps from different providers and display them over each other. 

This can be used to check the correctness of a map or check for discrepancies between providers.

## Installation

No complicated install procedure! Simply open `index.html` in your browser of choice.

_NOTE: We've only tested it in Chrome, but the latest versions of Firefox, Edge and Safari should work fine too._
